# Pomodorino üçÖ
Stay focused and grow your tomatoes!

### Sessions
A timer will show you how much longer you have to stay focused, and avoid using your smartphone, every time you start a new session.
Once you have reached your goal, your collection will gain a tomato. The harder you work, the more you have the chance to get rare and special ones. 
But beware: if you use your phone during the session, Pomodorino will not be happy and you will get a rotten tomato.

### Daily summary
You can see your sessions daily, find out which tomatoes you gained and how long you‚Äôve stayed focused. Our garden will grow even bigger soon and the session charts will be improved so... expect the best.

### Rankings
You can transform your tomatoes in tomato sauce. This way you will climb Google Play Games rankings. Who will make the most sauce?

### Pomodorini
Pomodorino, Pomodorina, Baby Pomodorino, Grandpa, Grandma and many others. Will you catch them all? Probably not, many brand new ones will be created!
